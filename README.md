its a simple app that'll run on amy platform ( uhh duhh cz its written using React native) 
3 main screen 1) Home 2)Restaurants 3)People
  1) Home: this will be the entry of the app. im not yet sure wht i'll put here but its the initial route
  2) Restaurants: will list out all the restaurants in the app also giving their info ie rating location etc but it has its own screen inside it
     2.1) Add Restaurants: this page allows users to add to the restayrants list
     2.2) Delete Restaurants: to delete restaurants
  3) People: lists out all the people in the app
     3.1) Add People: to add people
